# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect getElementById Usage

This repository demonstrates a subtle yet common error in HTML JavaScript interaction involving the `getElementById` method.  The error arises from incorrectly referencing an element's ID.

## The Bug
The `bug.html` file contains a simple HTML structure with a div element and a script that attempts to modify its content. However, the script has a subtle error that can cause it to fail silently or throw an error in some browsers. 

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.html` file presents the corrected version of the code. It highlights the correct usage of the `getElementById` method, ensuring that the script properly interacts with the intended HTML element.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.  Observe the unexpected behavior or errors.
3. Open `bugSolution.html` and observe the corrected output.

## Learning Points
- Always double-check your use of selectors (especially `getElementById` and `querySelector`) in your JavaScript to ensure you are targeting the correct HTML elements. 
- Consider adding error handling or logging to catch these issues early during development.
